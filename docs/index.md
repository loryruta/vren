VREN is my trial of writing a Vulkan renderer from scratch, I mainly experiment several rendering techniques while
trying to design a clean overlay over the Vulkan API.

**This is the site where I'll be writing about what I'm doing (and I did) with VREN. That time hasn't come yet, if you have reached this site
I'm glad you've got somehow interested in the project, but yeah, there's nothing here yet I'm sorry. :pensive:**
